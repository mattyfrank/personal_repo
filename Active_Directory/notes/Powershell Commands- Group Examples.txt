The following example demonstrates how to create a group named groupadmins in the Fabrikam.com domain:
      New-ADGroup -Name "RODC Admins" -SamAccountName groupadmins -GroupCategory Security -GroupScope Global 
        -DisplayName "Group Administrators" -Path "CN=Users,DC=Fabrikam,DC=Com" 


The following example demonstrates how to view the nested members of a group:
      Get-ADGroupMember <groupname> -Recursive | FT <attributes to display> 
      Get-ADGroupMember G1 -Recursive | FT Name,ObjectClass


The following example shows how to view the group membership of a single user, SaraDavis (this is slow to run):
    Get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership -Identity <user Account> 
    Get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership -Identity SaraDavis 
    Get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership SaraDavis | ft name, GroupCategory, GroupScope

The following example demonstrates how to add the user SaraDavis to the group SvcGroup:
      Add-ADGroupMember -Identity <groupname> -Member <User> 
      Add-ADGroupMember -Identity SvcGroup -Member SaraDavis 


The following example demonstrates how to remove the user SaraDavis from the group SvcGroup:
      Remove-ADGroupMember -Identity <groupname> -Member <User> 
      Remove-ADGroupMember -Identity SvcGroup -Member SaraDavis
